# README

This is a minimalist portfolio built on Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap. By default, it is configured to be used on Github Pages.

It is responsive, relatively lightweight, and easy to maintain. There's very little template magic.


## Philosophy

This portfolio template is built around the expectation that you know exactly what you want to show. And that the best portfolios are well-edited to show the best things.

This means:

1. No databases. If you aren't trying to show more than 1,000 items, you don't need a database
2. Everything is text (except for the images and assets you might link to). You can use HTML, but Markdown is easier.
3. Hand-code the details: there's no template magic to auto-place an image for you. If you want an image somewhere on the page, you put the appropriate code there.
4. Stick to single-column when possible.
